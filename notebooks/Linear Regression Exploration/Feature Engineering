# Linear Regression Exploration 4: Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of your linear regression model. In this section, we'll explore various techniques for feature engineering, including:

- **Polynomial Features:** Creating polynomial features to capture nonlinear relationships.
- **Interaction Features:** Combining or multiplying existing features to capture interactions.
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardizing or normalizing features to improve model convergence.
- **Binning and Categorization:** Converting numerical features into categorical ones for capturing non-linearity.

We'll provide code examples and practical guidance on how to apply these techniques to your dataset to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of your linear regression model.
