# Model Evaluation Metrics 1: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of regression models, including linear regression. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MAE indicates better model performance.

In this section, we'll delve into the details of MAE as a model evaluation metric. We'll explain how it works, its strengths and weaknesses, and how to interpret the results.

Additionally, we'll demonstrate how to calculate MAE using Python and scikit-learn and discuss scenarios where MAE is particularly useful.

By understanding MAE, you'll have a valuable tool for assessing the accuracy of your linear regression models.
