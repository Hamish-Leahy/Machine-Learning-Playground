# Model Evaluation Metrics 3: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a widely used metric for regression models, including linear regression. It is a variation of MSE, and RMSE measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. RMSE provides a more interpretable error metric since it is in the same unit as the target variable.

In this section, we'll explore RMSE as a model evaluation metric. We'll discuss its benefits, the relationship with MSE, and how to interpret RMSE values.

You'll also find practical examples of RMSE calculation using Python and scikit-learn.

By understanding RMSE, you'll have a valuable tool for assessing the precision and accuracy of your linear regression models.
