# Feature Selection

Feature selection is a crucial step in building an effective linear regression model. It involves identifying and choosing the most relevant features (variables) to include in the model. The goal is to improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability.

In this section, we'll explore various feature selection techniques and demonstrate how to apply them to our linear regression analysis.

## Techniques Covered

1. **Univariate Feature Selection:** This method selects features based on statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared, ANOVA) that measure the relationship between each feature and the target variable.

2. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** RFE recursively removes the least significant features until a specified number of features or a desired level of performance is achieved.

3. **Feature Importance from Tree-Based Models:** We'll leverage tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest) to compute feature importance scores and select the top features.

4. **L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression):** L1 regularization can shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively excluding them from the model.

## Implementation

We'll implement these feature selection techniques using Python and scikit-learn, providing code examples and explanations for each method. Additionally, we'll evaluate the impact of feature selection on our linear regression model's performance.

By the end of this section, you'll have a deep understanding of how to choose the most relevant features for your linear regression analysis, leading to more accurate and interpretable models.
