# Model Evaluation Metrics 2: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is another fundamental metric used in regression model evaluation. It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. MSE is sensitive to outliers and tends to penalize larger errors more significantly than MAE.

In this section, we'll explore MSE as a model evaluation metric. We'll explain its calculation, strengths, limitations, and when it's a preferred choice.

We'll also demonstrate how to compute MSE using Python and scikit-learn and provide insights into interpreting MSE results.

Understanding MSE will help you assess the predictive accuracy and performance of your linear regression models more comprehensively.
