# Model Evaluation Metrics 4: R-squared (R2) Score

R-squared (R2) is a crucial metric for evaluating the goodness-of-fit of regression models, including linear regression. It quantifies the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. A higher R2 score indicates a better-fitting model, with values ranging from 0 to 1.

In this section, we'll delve into the details of R-squared (R2) as a model evaluation metric. We'll explain its significance, interpretation, and how it relates to the explained variance.

You'll also find practical examples of how to calculate R2 scores using Python and scikit-learn, along with guidance on interpreting the results.

Understanding R2 will help you assess the overall performance and explanatory power of your linear regression models effectively.
