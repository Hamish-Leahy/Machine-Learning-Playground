# Cross-Validation 2: K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-Fold Cross-Validation is one of the most widely used cross-validation techniques. It divides the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds, trains and tests the model 'k' times, and then averages the results to assess model performance. K-Fold CV provides a robust estimate of a model's performance and helps in hyperparameter tuning.

In this section, we'll dive deep into K-Fold Cross-Validation. We'll explain how it works, how to implement it using Python and scikit-learn, and discuss its advantages and potential drawbacks.

Practical examples and code snippets will guide you through the process of applying K-Fold CV to your linear regression models.
