# Dataset Selection

To illustrate the concepts and techniques related to decision trees and random forests effectively, we need a suitable dataset that represents a real-world problem. In this section, we will introduce the dataset we have selected for this exploration and provide insights into its structure and content.

## Dataset Overview

For this exploration, we will be working with the "Real Estate Prices" dataset. This dataset contains information about various real estate properties, including both residential and commercial properties. Our goal is to predict the sale prices of these properties based on a set of relevant features.

### Features

The dataset includes a range of features that are commonly associated with real estate properties. Some of the key features in our dataset are as follows:

- `SquareFootage`: The total square footage of the property.
- `Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the property.
- `Bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms in the property.
- `Location`: The location of the property, typically represented as a categorical variable.
- `YearBuilt`: The year the property was constructed.
- `GarageSize`: The size of the garage (if applicable).

### Target Variable

Our target variable is `SalePrice`, which represents the sale price of the property. This is the variable we aim to predict using the features mentioned above.

## Dataset Source

The "Real Estate Prices" dataset was obtained from a reputable real estate database, ensuring its accuracy and relevance to our exploration.

## Data Exploration

In the subsequent sections of this notebook, we will perform a comprehensive exploration of the dataset. This exploration will include the following:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset to understand its structure.
- Performing data preprocessing steps if necessary, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Visualizing the data distribution and relationships between features and the target variable.
- Preparing the dataset for modeling with decision trees and random forests.

The choice of this dataset is intended to provide a practical and illustrative example of how decision trees and random forests can be applied to real-world predictive modeling tasks. We will use this dataset throughout the exploration to build, evaluate, and optimize our models.

Let's begin our exploration by loading and inspecting the "Real Estate Prices" dataset in the next section.
