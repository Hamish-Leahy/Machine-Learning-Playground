# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset (replace 'real_estate_dataset.csv' with your actual dataset file)
data = pd.read_csv('real_estate_dataset.csv')

# Explore the dataset
print("Dataset Summary:")
print(data.head())

# Data preprocessing
X = data[['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']]  # Include relevant features
y = data['SalePrice'].values

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Decision Tree model (Classifier or Regressor, depending on the task)
# For classification:
# model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
# For regression:
model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model (classification or regression, as appropriate)
# For classification:
# accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
# For regression:
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Visualize the Decision Tree (for classification tasks)
# Uncomment the following lines for classification tasks:
# from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
# plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
# plot_tree(model, filled=True, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=['Class 0', 'Class 1'])
# plt.show()

# Print model performance metrics
# For classification:
# print("Model Performance Metrics (Classification):")
# print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
# For regression:
print("Model Performance Metrics (Regression):")
print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse:.2f}")

# Conclusion
print("\nConclusion:")
print("This notebook explores Decision Trees, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. It includes loading and preprocessing data, splitting it into training and testing sets, training a Decision Tree model (Classifier or Regressor), and evaluating its performance.")
