# Logistic Regression for Classification 3: Training and Evaluation

Training a Logistic Regression model involves optimizing its parameters to fit the training data while maintaining good generalization to unseen data. Evaluating the model's performance is equally important.

In this section, we'll cover the following topics:

- **Training Logistic Regression:** We'll explain the training process, including cost functions (e.g., log-likelihood), optimization methods (e.g., gradient descent), and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Model Evaluation:** We'll introduce key metrics for evaluating classification models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

- **Cross-Validation:** Learn how to use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization performance and prevent overfitting.

By the end of this section, you'll be well-equipped to train, evaluate, and fine-tune Logistic Regression models for classification tasks.
