# Logistic Regression for Classification 2: Model Formulation

Logistic Regression uses the logistic function (sigmoid function) to model the relationship between features and the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class. Understanding the model formulation is crucial for effective utilization.

In this section, we'll dive deep into the mathematical underpinnings of Logistic Regression. We'll explain the logistic function, the log-odds ratio, and how the model's parameters are learned.

You'll also find Python code examples illustrating model formulation and parameter estimation.
