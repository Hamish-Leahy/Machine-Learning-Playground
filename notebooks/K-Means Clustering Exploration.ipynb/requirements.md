# External Libraries and Dependencies

To run the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, you'll need to have certain Python libraries and dependencies installed on your system. You can easily install these libraries using `pip` or `conda`. Below is a list of the required packages along with installation instructions:

### Required Libraries:

- **Python**: Python is the programming language used for this notebook. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a Python distribution like Anaconda.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is used for numerical operations and array manipulations. Install it with:

  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```

- **Pandas**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. Install it with:

  ```
  pip install pandas
  ```

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is used for data visualization. Install it with:

  ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

- **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn provides machine learning tools, including K-Means clustering. Install it with:

  ```
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```

### Optional Libraries (Depending on Notebook Content):

- [List any optional libraries or dependencies here, if applicable.]

### Installing Dependencies:

You can install all the required libraries at once by creating a virtual environment (recommended) or by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should contain the names of the required libraries and their versions, like this:

```
numpy==1.21.0
pandas==1.3.0
matplotlib==3.4.2
scikit-learn==0.24.2
```

Before running the notebook, make sure you have installed these dependencies to ensure a smooth experience. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for assistance.

[Your Organization/Project Name]

In this Markdown file:

- Replace `[Your Organization/Project Name]` with the name of your organization or project.
- List the required libraries and dependencies along with installation instructions.
- Include any optional libraries if your notebook has optional content that requires additional packages.
- Provide a command to install all dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file, if you prefer to manage dependencies this way.
